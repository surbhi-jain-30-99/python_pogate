String:
In Python, a sequence of characters, like "Hello Python", is called a string.
A string needs to be enclosed in single ' or double " quotes.
The output will be the same either way.
If you don't put it in quotes, you will get an error.

Adding  comments:
Adding # at the beginning will make the entire line a comment.
Comments will not be executed when running code, so you can use them to leave notes.

Integers:
You can use numbers like integers in programming.
Unlike strings, they don't need to be enclosed in quotes.
You can add and subtract integers just like you do in math.
The spaces before and after operators are not required, but they will make the code easier to read.


Difference betweenStrings and Integers:

Strings and integers are interpreted differently in programming.
Like the images below, 3 + 5 will print 8, which is the result of the addition. However, if you enclose it in quotes and make it a string, the output will stay as 3 + 5.
